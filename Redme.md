⚡ The Vibe
PROMPT FORGE PRO isn't just a form; it's a command center for your imagination. Wrapped in a Dark Mode / Neon Gradient UI, it guides you through a 9-step architectural process to construct the perfect AI image generation prompt.
No messy text files. No forgotten parameters. Just a clean, linear flow from concept to clipboard.
🧠 Smart Logic
 * Face Protection: Intelligent toggle that injects specific weights (maintain exact facial features:1.5) to keep your subject recognizable when using reference images.
 * Magic Presets: One-click configuration for styles like Cyberpunk, Studio Ghibli, or Octane Render.
 * Live Syntax: Watch your prompt build in real-time at the bottom of the screen as you toggle switches.
